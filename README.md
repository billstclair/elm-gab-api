[billstclair/elm-gab-api](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-gab-api/latest) is a pure Elm interface to the [Gab.com](https://gab.com/) application programming interface.

Gab uses a REST interface, documented at [developers.gab.com](https://developers.gab.com/). Developer access is available only to Gab PRO members, but Andrew Torba [has offered](https://gab.ai/gab/posts/37368168) a trial of PRO to interested developers.
