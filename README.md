The links on the two shields above don't work yet. This a work in progress.

`elm-gab-api` is a pure Elm interface to the [Gab.com](https://gab.com/) application programming interface.

Gab uses a REST interface, documented at [developers.gab.com](https://developers.gab.com/). Developer access is available only to Gab PRO members, but Andrew Torba [has offered](https://gab.ai/gab/posts/37368168) a trial of PRO to interested developers.
